            <p>Amid the post-war boom of Hollywood's Golden Age, Cole Phelps — an LAPD detective — is thrown headfirst into a city drowning in its own success.

In his fight to climb the ranks and do what's right, Phelps must unravel the truth behind a string of arson attacks, racketeering conspiracies, and brutal murders, battling the L.A. underworld and even members of his own department to uncover a secret that could shake the city to its rotten core.</p>
